This repository compiles all the **concepts**, **code snippets**, and **practical exercises** I work on while learning C++.

My main interests are:

- **Telecommunications**
- **Systems programming**
- **Networking**

The projects here will range from very basic pointer exercises to more advanced system-level experiments.  
Each week Iâ€™ll add new projects to track my progress and build a solid foundation in C++ and low-level programming.

Each folder contains its own README.md with:

- Project description
- What I learned

## Goal

To gradually build the skills needed for **systems-level C++ programming** with a focus on telecom and networking applications.
